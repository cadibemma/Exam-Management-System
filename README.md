# Exam-Management-System
In this project, A professor is able to add questions to the bank and use selected questions to create an exam. Students then login to take the exam, submit, and the exam is autograded. Professor logs back in to review the exam and can modify their grade. Professor then update new grade and release scores to students to see the grade and review exam. For this project, I was mainly responsible for the layout/design of the website and how the data from the database is displayed.
